save all in same folder

open them with matlab

make "aco.m" tab active

put a breakpoint at line 23 (just click on the dash mark beside line 23 id)

run it

Note: it will just create a 4 nodes graph, create connections (edges) between them and plot. 

If you need more nodes, add more "static locations" at "createGraph.m" file (i leave a comment there) and thats enough.

checkout next versions to get the the implemented code every version
