matlab codes for beginners and intermediate users


every folder, identified by a "version number" have a implementation of the code.

the V1 have a simple matlab code to create a simple "network" with 4 nodes with fixed location and plot in a graph all possible paths to the othe ones, like a mesh network.

I am doing this (sharing) because of my masters degree and i hope can help someone, because i just haven't it when i need! (SO SAD!!!)

By the way i am not a matlab professional, am i just a simple person trying to understand matlab and sharing some codes in the hope of help some one!

choose the version that gets closer to the scenario you need!

Cheers mate hope i helped you!
